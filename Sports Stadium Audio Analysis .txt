# Sports Stadium Audio Analysis  
## A Multi‑Camera, Multi‑Device Phase Guide

This guide adapts the bat-crack/glove-thud and concert workflows to **sports stadium events** — a bat crack, referee whistle, goal celebration cheer, or other sharp transients. It uses **multiple audience devices** (phones, cameras, mics) to:

- align unsynced recordings,
- measure **relative phase and cycle offsets** between devices,
- interpret offsets physically (time, distance, seating geometry),
- and verify consistency across the game/event.

It builds on midrange physics, phase matrices, and adversarial checks for crowdsourced stadium forensics, sync, or reconstruction.

## 1. The Physical Event (Ground Truth)

### 1.1 Key acoustic anchors
Sports events produce repeatable **impulsive sounds**:

1. **Primary transient** (e.g., bat crack, field goal kick, basketball rim clang, soccer ball strike)  
   - Sharp onset, strong midrange energy (≈800–1500 Hz)  
   - Excellent for phase analysis; repeatable

2. **Secondary transient** (e.g., referee whistle, crowd cheer peak, goal horn, announcer call)  
   - Slightly broader or delayed spectrum  
   - Use as time-interval anchor

These act as **shared impulses** like bat/glove or kick/snare.

---

## 2. What the Devices Capture

Each phone / camera records:

- Video (frame clock)
- Audio (ADC clock)
- Unknown start time
- Unknown latency
- Possible drift over quarters/halves

**No shared sync.**  
Relative phase reveals seating positions and field-to-stands delays.

## 3. Why Narrowband Phase Works Here

### 3.1 Choice of frequency band
Isolate midrange:

- **Center:** ~1000 Hz  
- **Bandwidth:** ~50–100 Hz (Q ≈ 10–20)

Reasons:
- Human-scale wavelength (~0.34 m / ~1.13 ft)
- Stable across phone mics
- Transients ring cleanly after filtering
- Phase maps to distance intuitively

At 70°F:
- Speed of sound ≈ **344 m/s**
- Wavelength at 1 kHz ≈ **0.344 m (~1.13 ft)**

So:
- **1 cycle = 1 ms = ~1.13 ft of propagation**

Stadium PA/crowd reverb adds challenge — midrange cuts through best.

---

## 4. Pre‑Processing Workflow (All Devices)

### Step 1 — Extract audio
- Export from every video
- Same sample rate (e.g., 48 kHz)
- Mono preferred

### Step 2 — Rough alignment
- Line up a **strong transient** (e.g., first bat crack or whistle) via video
- Accuracy: within ~50–200 ms
- Use crowd reaction or scoreboard for cross-check

### Step 3 — Band‑pass filtering
- Apply narrow bandpass (e.g., 1000 Hz ±50 Hz)
- Render to new files
- Result: ringing quasi‑sinusoid per device

## 5. Phase Measurement Between Devices

### 5.1 Reference selection
Choose one track:
- Highest SNR (e.g., field-level / lower bowl device)
- Cleanest transient onset

All others relative to this.

### 5.2 Measure phase / cycles
For each device pair:

- Use GCC‑PHAT or cycle counting for Δt
- Convert:
  - Cycles = Δt × f
  - Phase = cycles × 360° (mod 360)

Example:
- 150 cycles @ 1 kHz  
→ 150 ms  
→ ~169 ft path difference (lower bowl to upper deck)

---

## 6. Building the Phase Relation Matrix

Create a matrix:
- Rows/columns = devices
- Entries = Δt, cycles, or phase per transient

This matrix maps **stadium geometry**:
- Field-level clusters: small offsets
- Upper-deck lags: large cycle counts

Triangle check:
Δt(A,B) + Δt(B,C) ≈ Δt(A,C)

Violations flag drift, PA delay artifacts, or fakes.

---

## 7. Interpreting the Primary Transient (e.g., Bat Crack / Kick)

For a sharp **field impulse**:

- All devices hear the same source
- Phase offsets reflect:
  - distances from field to seating (sound speed delay)
  - constant device latency

With stadium PA/crowd:
- GCC-PHAT isolates direct sound
- Coherence drops with distance/seating

This anchors the "bat crack" equivalent.

---

## 8. Interpreting the Secondary Transient (e.g., Whistle / Crowd Cheer)

A later cue (e.g., referee whistle, goal cheer) occurs ~seconds later.

Each device:
- Measures new Δt relative to its own primary time
- Phase repeatable across cues

Primary → Secondary interval per device:
- Dominated by **game timing** (not sound propagation)
- Verifies clock drift over quarters

---

## 9. Connecting Cycles to Real Physics

Stadium example:
- Distance field → upper deck ≈ 300 ft (91 m)
- Δt ≈ 266 ms
- Cycles ≈ **266** at 1 kHz

This explains:
- Lower-to-upper offsets map seating tiers
- Large cycle counts over stadium scales
- Small **differences** (few cycles) encode row/seat geometry

---

## 10. Multi‑Device Consistency Across the Game

A valid set shows:

- Per-transient matrix: consistent
- Game-long phase: stable (no drift)
- Multi‑band agreement (e.g., 1000 vs 1200 Hz)
- Reverb/PA tolerance: phase jitter increases with distance

Failures:
- drifting offsets (clock skew)
- band mismatch (editing)
- outlier clusters (replays)

---

## 11. Adversarial & Reality Checks

Apply the protocol:

- Multi‑band confirmation
- Global residual minimization
- Outlier rejection
- Cluster detection

A real game:
- Fits one stadium geometry
- Degrades with crowd/PA noise
- Cannot be faked cheaply (phase must align across transients)

## 12. Yankee Stadium Example (Real-World Application)

**Scenario**: 2025 Yankees vs. Red Sox game, bottom of the 9th, Aaron Judge at bat.  
- Bat crack (primary transient)  
- Ball hits glove (secondary transient, ~0.4 s later)

**Devices**:
- Device A: Lower box, ~80 ft from home plate
- Device B: Mezzanine, ~180 ft from home plate
- Device C: Upper deck, ~320 ft from home plate

**Phase matrix for bat crack (1 kHz)**:
- A → B: +88 cycles (~88 ms, ~99 ft path difference)  
- A → C: +212 cycles (~212 ms, ~240 ft path difference)  
- B → C: +124 cycles (~124 ms, ~140 ft path difference)

**Triangle check**: 88 + 124 ≈ 212 → passes (within ~2 ms error from reverb/noise)

**Interpretation**:
- Device A (reference) → closest to field  
- Device B → ~100 ft farther (consistent with mezzanine seating)  
- Device C → ~240 ft farther (matches upper deck to home plate)  
- Glove thud interval ≈ 400 ms across all → ball flight time (not sound delay)

**Result**: All three clips are from the same real play; seating geometry reconstructed; no evidence of edits or replays.

## 13. Mental Model Summary

- **Sound lacks timestamps**
- **Phase encodes geometry**
- **Cycles are just distance in disguise**
- **Truth from consistency, not perfection**

This adapts the bat-glove and concert cases to stadiums' scale, PA delays, and crowd reverb.
