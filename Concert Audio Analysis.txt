# Concert Audio Analysis  
## A Multi‑Camera, Multi‑Device Phase Guide

This guide adapts the **bat crack → glove thud** workflow to concert audio. It shows how a live performance — with sharp transients like kick/snare hits or vocal cues — can be analyzed using **multiple audience devices** to:

- align unsynced recordings,
- measure **relative phase and cycle offsets** between devices,
- interpret those offsets physically (time, distance, venue geometry),
- and verify consistency across the set.

It builds on the phase-relation protocol, adversarial checks, and midrange physics for crowdsourced concert forensics or reconstruction.

## 1. The Physical Event (Ground Truth)

### 1.1 Key acoustic anchors
A concert set produces repeated **impulsive sounds** across songs:

1. **Kick drum / snare crack**  
   - Sharp onset, strong midrange energy (≈800–1500 Hz)  
   - Ideal for phase analysis; repeatable across the set  

2. **Vocal cue or cymbal crash**  
   - Slightly broader spectrum, but trackable  
   - Use as secondary anchor for time intervals  

These serve as **shared transients** like the bat/glove pair.

## 2. What the Devices Capture

Each phone / camera records:

- Video (with its own frame clock)
- Audio (with its own ADC clock)
- Unknown start time
- Unknown constant latency
- Possible drift over a long set

**No shared sync.**  
Relative phase reveals venue positions and consistency.

## 3. Why Narrowband Phase Works Here

### 3.1 Choice of frequency band
Isolate midrange, e.g.:

- **Center:** ~1000 Hz  
- **Bandwidth:** ~50–100 Hz (Q ≈ 10–20)

Reasons:
- Human-scale wavelength (~0.34 m / ~1.1 ft)
- Stable across phone mics
- Transients ring cleanly after filtering
- Phase maps to distance intuitively

At 70°F:
- Speed of sound ≈ **344 m/s**
- Wavelength at 1 kHz ≈ **0.344 m (~1.13 ft)**

So:
- **1 cycle = 1 ms = ~1.13 ft of propagation**

Concert reverb adds challenge — midrange cuts through.

## 4. Pre‑Processing Workflow (All Devices)

### Step 1 — Extract audio
- Export from every video
- Same sample rate (e.g., 48 kHz)
- Mono preferred

### Step 2 — Rough alignment
- Line up a **strong transient** (e.g., first kick hit)
- Accuracy: within ~50–100 ms
- Use video applause or stage lights for cross-check

### Step 3 — Band‑pass filtering
- Apply narrow bandpass (e.g., 1000 Hz ±50 Hz)
- Render to new files
- Result: ringing quasi‑sinusoid per device

## 5. Phase Measurement Between Devices

### 5.1 Reference selection
Choose one track:
- Highest SNR (e.g., front-row device)
- Cleanest transient onset

All others relative to this.

### 5.2 Measure phase / cycles
For each device pair:

- Use GCC‑PHAT or cycle counting for Δt
- Convert:
  - Cycles = Δt × f
  - Phase = cycles × 360° (mod 360)

Example:
- 45 cycles @ 1 kHz  
→ 45 ms  
→ ~51 ft path difference (front to back row)

---

## 6. Building the Phase Relation Matrix

Create a matrix:
- Rows/columns = devices
- Entries = Δt, cycles, or phase per transient

This matrix maps **venue geometry**:
- Front-row clusters: small offsets
- Back-row lags: large cycle counts

Triangle check:
Δt(A,B) + Δt(B,C) ≈ Δt(A,C)

Violations flag drift, reverb artifacts, or fakes.

---

## 7. Interpreting the Kick / Snare Crack

For a sharp **kick/snare**:

- All devices hear the same stage impulse
- Phase offsets reflect:
  - distances to stage (sound speed delay)
  - constant device latency

With venue reverb:
- GCC-PHAT helps isolate direct sound
- Coherence drops with distance

This anchors the "bat crack" equivalent.

---

## 8. Interpreting the Vocal Cue or Crash

A later cue (e.g., vocal "hey!") occurs ~seconds/minutes after.

Each device:
- Measures new Δt relative to its own kick time
- Phase repeatable across cues

Kick → Cue interval per device:
- Dominated by **performance timing** (not sound propagation)
- Verifies clock drift over set

---

## 9. Connecting Cycles to Real Physics

Concert example:
- Distance stage → back row ≈ 200 ft (61 m)
- Δt ≈ 177 ms
- Cycles ≈ **177** at 1 kHz

This explains:
- Front/back offsets map seating
- Large cycle counts over venue scales
- Small **differences** (few cycles) encode row/seat geometry

---

## 10. Multi‑Device Consistency Across the Set

A valid concert set shows:

- Per-transient matrix: consistent
- Set-long phase: stable (no drift)
- Multi‑band agreement (e.g., 1000 vs 1200 Hz)
- Reverb tolerance: phase jitter increases with distance

Failures:
- drifting offsets (clock skew)
- band mismatch (editing)
- outlier clusters (replays)

---

## 11. Adversarial & Reality Checks

Apply the protocol:

- Multi‑band confirmation
- Global residual minimization
- Outlier rejection
- Cluster detection

A real concert:
- Fits one venue geometry
- Degrades with crowd noise/reverb
- Cannot be faked cheaply (phase must align across transients)

---

## 12. What This Ultimately Gives You

From unsynced audience clips, you can:

- Sync the set for a "crowd master" mix
- Map approximate seating/venue layout
- Detect fakes or edits in viral clips
- Tie phase to **human‑scale distances** (e.g., front vs back row)

The kick/snare is not just a beat —  
it is a **shared acoustic constraint** etched into every device.

## 13. Mental Model Summary

- **Sound lacks timestamps**
- **Phase encodes geometry**
- **Cycles are just distance in disguise**
- **Truth from consistency, not perfection**

This adapts the bat-glove case to concerts' scale and reverb.
